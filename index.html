            <h2>About the app</h2>
            <p>I grew up in an engineering household, and i've watched plenty of engineering students graduate and still not fully understand how part of things work. So I wanted to develop an app to help upcoming engineers with things all in one place, versus having to spend hours on the internet looking for each module or set of instructions. Everything is in one place for you to easy access anything. That is my goal. Verified by real engineers, in real time. </p>
